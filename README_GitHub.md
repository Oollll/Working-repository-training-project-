# Git 

## Requirements
If you want to create pull requests through the terminal instead of the GUI, I recommend running the following commands :

### Step 1: Install the GitHub CLI

#### For Windows:
```
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```
#### For MacOS:
```
brew install gh
```
### Step 2: Log in to GitHub
```
gh auth login
```

# Tasks: 
##### 1. Create your own repository with a filled file(s).
  - Push your repository to GitHub.

a. Go to GitHub, click on the + icon, and select New repository.
b. Fill in the repository details (name, description, public/private).
c. Click Create repository.
    






Create your own repository with a filled file(s).
Push your repository to GitHub.

Create a master branch and protect it.
Create your work branch. 
Add any files and edit some records in existing files.

Add your changes from the work branch to the master branch. 
(Make a merge-request/pull-request from your branch and close it. Cope with conflicts if there are.)

Back repository to someone's old commit.
